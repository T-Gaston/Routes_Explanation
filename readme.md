#Routes on Rails!

###What are they?

Routes are HTTP methods that your computer and a server use to communicate with each other over the internet.
More specifically, routes are linked to what we call CRUD actions in our Rails controllers.

1. C ** Create (Post)
2. R ** Read (Get)
3. U ** Update (Put)
4. D ** Destroy (Delete)
